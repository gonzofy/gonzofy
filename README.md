# Professional Life

Co-Founder, [Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/). For the last bunch of years I've been leading the marketing team and other go-to-market functions and haven't been able to code as much. I miss it. I do little projects on the side from time to time to scratch the itch.

## Getting in Touch

DM on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robgonzalez/) is the easiest way to contact me these days.

# Emacs

I love Emacs. These days I'm in Org Mode all the time. Yak Shaving gives me a chace to scratch my programming itch.

# Linux Fan

I used Linux (Debian) as my primary OS from late 90s until 2012 (aside: thank you VMware for making that possible in a professional setting back then), when I switched to OSX for most of the 2010s. I'm back on Linux (OpenSUSE) as my daily driver; wow Linux has come a long way! It's so easy these days.

# Programming

[Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/) is primarily a Ruby + Javascript shop (though is diversifying more these days), and at IBM and Endeca I was mostly using Java. In the 90s I cut my teeth on C, and in college I loved ML and Lisp. So I can hack around and do damage in a wide variety of languages, but I'm unfortunately not expert in any of them.

As a hobby I've been learning Common Lisp and Elisp.

## A Note on PHP

Kindof a funny story: I'm not really into PHP (no judgement, just not my preference), but in 2013 or 2014 I built a Magento plugin for Salsify and couldn't find a JSON parser in PHP suitable for very large JSON files, so I [wrote one](https://github.com/salsify/jsonstreamingparser). It has over 700 stars and is, ironically, the most popular, widely used code I've ever written.
