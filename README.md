# Professional Life

Co-Founder, [Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/). For the last bunch of years I've been leading the marketing team and other go-to-market functions and haven't been able to code much. I miss it. I do little projects on the side from time to time to scratch the itch.


# Side Projects

I use Excel and/or LibreOffice Calc all the time and have a crazy number of docs in .xlsx. We have a bunch of Ruby scripts at Salsify that manipulate (or create, some of the file creation from data in data pools in so cool) large amounts of data in the context of xlsx docs, and I'm mucking around with Python versions to dip my toes in the Python world for the first time.


# Programming

[Salsify](https://www.salsify.com/) is primarily a Ruby + Javascript shop (though is diversifying more these days), and at IBM and Endeca I was mostly using Java. In the 90s I cut my teeth on C, and in college I loved ML and Lisp (this is before Scheme became hugely popular). So I can hack around and do damage in a wide variety of languages, but I'm unfortunately not expert in any of them.

## JAMstack

I've built a handful of sites on Jekyll, hosted on S3, and would like to do more on the JAMstack at some point. I had a side gig building Wordpress plugins and themes in the 2000s, and the JAMstack has been a nice change. (No judgement on Wordpress &mdash; it's awesome &mdash; I just enjoy tinkering with new things, and particularly appreciate that I can publish a Jekyll site and just never have to worry about security patches and such.)

## A Note on PHP

Kindof a funny story: I'm not really into PHP (no judgement, just not my preference), but in 2013 or 2014 I built a Magento plugin for Salsify and couldn't find a JSON parser in PHP suitable for very large JSON files, so I [wrote on](https://github.com/salsify/jsonstreamingparser). It has over 600 stars and is, ironically, the most popular, widely used code I've ever written.


# Linux Fan

I used Linux (Debian) as my primary OS from late 90s until 2012 (aside: thank you VMWare for making that possible in a professional setting), when I switched to OSX for most of the 2010s. I'm back on Linux (Manjaro) as my daily driver (wow Linux has come a long way!), but still use OSX and Windows 10 here and there.
